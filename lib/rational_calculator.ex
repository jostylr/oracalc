defmodule RationalCalculator do
  @moduledoc """
  Ratcalc facilitates rational calculation of real number quantities.

  It consists of a Fraction module that does fraction arithmetic, an Interval module that does the computation of intervals that contain a given number, and then the modules function, geometry, and calculus provide various tools for doing actual computations. Specifically, functions gives elementary functions, calculus operates on those functions, and geometry implements rational trigonometry (See Norm Wildberger's Divine Proportions) as well as useful geometric algorithms.

  This module I am not sure how it all ties it together yet.
